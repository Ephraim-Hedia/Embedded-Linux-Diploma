Where are the Manual Pages ?
	- the 'man' command reads from the manual pages stored in your distribution 
	- the location of these pages may differ slightly based on the distribution 
	- use the command 'manpath' to know the location of the man pages on you manchine 
	- This command identify the location of the man pages based on the configuration file "/etc/manpath.cfg"
	- sometimes we will have an Environment variable MANPATH for that purpose too 
		echo $MANPATH
	- Typically they are located in /usr/share/man/

The Manual Sections :
	- the man pages are classified into multiple sections with numbers :
		1- for Commands 
		2- for system calls 
		3- C Library Functions 
		4- Sepcial filenames 
		5- file formats for linux files
		6- games and things like screen savers
		7- word processing packages & Misc
		8- System administration commands
		
Selecting the Manual Section :
	-We can decide which section we want to show from the man page 
		man <n> <name>
		Ex : 	man 1 passwd
			man 5 passwd 	(/etc/passwd)
			msn passwd (Default is section 1 ; the command)
	- To Learn more about the man command

The 'whatis' Database :
	- The 'whatis' database is a database containing a selected parts of the man pages :
		- Title 
		- Section Number 
		- Name field
	- This database  is used with the commands 		
		- whatis
		- apropos
		
whatis Command :
	Search in Titles and then print 3 Sections :
		Title , Section Number , Description (From Name field)
	whatis ls --> ls(1)	-List directory Contents
	
apropos Command :
	Search in all database not only title
	Ex : 	apropos process 	(Searches for the commands dealing with process)

		man -k <keyword>
		
		
info Command :
	- info <Command> (Display the info pages on the command) 
	- The GNU Commands will have both man pages and info pages :
